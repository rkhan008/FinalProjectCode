# FinalProjectCode
This repository contains all the code for the final project.

Accessing model notebook  In order to access the covid-19 model, you will need visit google colab. You will then need to create a Google account if you don't already have one. If you wish to run the code, you will be required to move the entire 'FinalCovidModel' folder into your Google drive. Then you need to open the 'CovidModelColab.ipynb' file within the 'FinalCovidModel'. If you just wish to view the code within the notebook, you do not need to move the entire 'FinalCovidModel' file to drive. You can simply open the 'CovidModelColab.ipynb' file.
Accessing website code  To run the website code, you will need a code editor that is compatible with Python (e.g. Visual Studio Code). you will then be required to download all the libraries specified within the 'requirements.txt' file. This file can be found within the 'Covid Website' folder. You can pip install the file to downlaod all the libraries. Once all the libraries have been installed you may wish to run the website locally by running the app.py file.
