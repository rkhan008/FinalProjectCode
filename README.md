# FinalProjectCode
This repository contains all the code for the final project.

**Accessing model notebook** <br>
In order to access the covid-19 model, you will need visit Google colab. You will then need to create a Google account if you don't already have one. If you wish to just view the code within the notebook simply open the CovidModelColab.ipynb' file within 'FinalCovidModel' folder using Google Colab. However, if you wish to run the code you will be required to download the image dataset and put this dataset within the 'FinalCovidModel' file. This 'FinalCovidModel' file must then be uploaded onto your Google Drive account. Then you can run the code with the dataset.

The dataset can be found and downloaded from the following link - https://www.kaggle.com/rubelk/covid-image-dataset![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84961946/119962188-b22d8e00-bf9e-11eb-924c-39ff01d2af76.png)


**Accessing website code** <br>
To run the website code, you will need a code editor that is compatible with Python (e.g. Visual Studio Code). you will then be required to download all the libraries specified within the 'requirements.txt' file. This file can be found within the 'Covid Website' folder. You can pip install the file to download all the libraries. Once all the libraries have been installed, you may wish to run the website locally by running the app.py file.
